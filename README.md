XGen
===============

XGen is a small script to parse XML files and generate the xpath for each unique element. The primary use of this application is to allow easy mapping and documentation of XML files. The output is formatted in a table in order to allow easy documentation and use accross other applications.

XGen-complete
===============

XGen-complete has all the functionality of XGen but everything is put into one file. This was done in order to allow easy offline access and distribution of the application.

Contributions
===============

XGen is under active development. Any advice or help is greately appreciated and will receive prompt response.
